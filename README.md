# decomotor
Unsupervised Bayesian Ising Approximation for decoding neural-motor dictionaries. Here we present the code corresponding to the paper:
<-to be completed->

The code in this repository follows a method for decoding neural activity in relation to motor behavior, expanding on the approach BIA by Fisher and Mehta (2015).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Tha main code of this project is written in Mathematica v10 (and tested on v11, as well).

The repository contains a demo in a jupyter notebook (python).

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

As a first step, we need to create the scripts in our local Mathematica, in order to be sure that they will run properly:
```
math creating_scripts.m
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
